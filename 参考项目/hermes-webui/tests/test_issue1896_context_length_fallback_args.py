"""Regression checks for #1896 — context-length fallback ignores config overrides.

The two `get_model_context_length()` fallback callsites in `api/streaming.py`
(one for session persistence around line ~2950, one for the SSE usage payload
around line ~3050) were calling the resolver with only `model + base_url`,
omitting `config_context_length`, `provider`, and `custom_providers`.

When the agent's `context_compressor` reports 0 (fresh / cached / transitioning
agent), context-length resolution falls all the way through to
`DEFAULT_FALLBACK_CONTEXT = 256_000` even when the user has set
`model.context_length: 1048576` in `config.yaml` or has a 1M model with a
`custom_providers` per-model override.

For users with a context-management plugin (LCM) configured around the real
window, this cascades into a session-killing failure mode: auto-compression
triggers far too early → flood of compress requests → 429s → credential pool
exhaustion → fallback also 429s → "API call failed after 3 retries".

These tests pin the call shape so future refactors can't silently drop the
config-override args again.
