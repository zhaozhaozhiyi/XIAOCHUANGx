"""Regression tests for composer attach-thumb lightbox click behaviour.

User pasted/dropped/picked an image and wants to verify the right one
attached before sending. Clicking the thumbnail in the composer's
attach-tray should open the existing image lightbox (the same one
that's wired to message-attached images).

This file pins the wiring at the source level — the document-level
delegated click handler must:
  - Continue handling .msg-media-img (existing v0.50.x behaviour).
  - Also handle .attach-thumb on IMG elements (new in this PR).
  - NOT trigger on the chip's × remove button (sibling element).
  - NOT trigger on audio/video chips (those have native controls).

It also pins the CSS cursor affordance so users discover the feature.
