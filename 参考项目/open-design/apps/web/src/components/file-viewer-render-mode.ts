/**
 * Decide between two HTML preview render strategies in FileViewer:
 *
 *   - URL-load: <iframe src="/api/projects/:id/raw/:file"> — the browser
 *     fetches each <script src> / <link href> as its own request. Source
 *     maps work, DevTools shows real filenames, per-asset HTTP caching
 *     applies, and a single broken file no longer takes down the whole
 *     iframe. This is the right default for multi-file artifacts (e.g.
 *     React prototypes that ship dozens of `.jsx` files).
 *
 *   - srcDoc inline: build a self-contained document (via buildSrcdoc),
 *     optionally with relative assets concatenated in by inlineRelative-
 *     Assets, and pass it via the iframe's srcDoc attribute. Required
 *     when we need to inject host-side bridges that cannot be served from
 *     the artifact itself (deck navigation, inspect/tweak controls), and
 *     useful as an explicit opt-in for self-contained exports.
 *
 * The two helpers below isolate the decision so it's directly unit-
 * testable without dragging the whole FileViewer React tree into a
 * jsdom harness.

/**
 * Return true when the HTML source contains patterns that fail under the

 *
 * The srcDoc path runs `injectSandboxShim` (see
 * `apps/web/src/runtime/srcdoc.ts`) before any user script, which polyfills
 * `localStorage` / `sessionStorage` so artifacts that read them at mount
 * don't throw `SecurityError` and unmount the React tree. The URL-load path
 * serves raw HTML untouched, so artifacts that touch sandbox-blocked Web
 * Storage at startup go blank.
 *
 * Scope is narrow on purpose. This helper detects two reliable signals
 * visible in the *document* source and routes those artifacts back through
 * srcDoc by toggling `forceInline`:
 *
 *   - `<script type="text/babel">` (quoted or unquoted): Babel-standalone
 *     XHR-fetches and evals sibling `.jsx`/`.tsx` files at runtime.
 *     Agent-emitted React prototypes in this style routinely read Web
 *     Storage from `useState` initializers.
 *   - Direct `localStorage` / `sessionStorage` mentions in the document
 *     source (covers inline scripts and plain HTML that calls them).
 *
 * Known limitation: a `<script src="./app.js">` (or
 * `<script type="module" src="./main.js">`) whose **external** file reads
 * Web Storage at module eval is *not* covered — the helper only sees the
 * HTML, not the linked subresource, so URL-load is still chosen and the
 * SecurityError still throws. Catching that case would require fetching
 * and scanning every script reference before deciding the iframe load
 * strategy, which duplicates work the browser is about to do and adds
 * round trips on every preview load. Leaving that path uncovered until
 * there's a reported case that justifies the cost. Workaround for now:
 * users can opt the artifact into srcDoc with `?forceInline=1` or by
 * toggling Tweaks.
 *
 * Pure string scan — caller passes the same `source` already fetched for
 * preview rendering, so this adds no extra I/O. Heuristic by design: false
 * positives just take the (slightly slower but safer) srcDoc path; false
 * negatives are the same blank-preview the user already hits.
