# Directory guide

This file is the single source of truth for agents entering this repository. Read this file first; after entering `apps/`, `packages/`, `tools/`, or `e2e/`, read that layer's `AGENTS.md` for module-level details. Do not copy module details back into the root file; root stays focused on cross-repository boundaries, workflow, and commands.

## Core documentation index

- Product and onboarding: `README.md`, `README.zh-CN.md`, `QUICKSTART.md`.
- Contribution and environment: `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.zh-CN.md`.
- Architecture and protocols: `docs/spec.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/skills-protocol.md`, `docs/agent-adapters.md`, `docs/modes.md`.
- Roadmap and references: `docs/roadmap.md`, `docs/references.md`, `docs/code-review-guidelines.md`, `specs/current/maintainability-roadmap.md`.
- Directory-level agent guidance: `apps/AGENTS.md`, `packages/AGENTS.md`, `tools/AGENTS.md`, `e2e/AGENTS.md`.
- Packaged auto-update architecture and high-confidence local harness: read `tools/pack/AGENTS.md` section "Packaged auto-update architecture and harness" before touching packaged updater code, release-channel identity, installer behavior, or updater UI.

## Workspace directories

- Workspace packages come from `pnpm-workspace.yaml`: `apps/*`, `packages/*`, `tools/*`, and `e2e`.
- Top-level content directories: `skills/` (functional skills the agent invokes mid-task — utilities, briefs, packagers; see `skills/AGENTS.md`), `design-templates/` (rendering catalogue: decks, prototypes, image/video/audio templates; see `design-templates/AGENTS.md` and `specs/current/skills-and-design-templates.md`), `design-systems/` (brand `DESIGN.md` files), `craft/` (universal brand-agnostic craft rules a skill can opt into via `od.craft.requires`).
- `apps/web` is the Next.js 16 App Router + React 18 web runtime; do not restore `apps/nextjs`.
- `apps/daemon` is the local privileged daemon and `od` bin. It owns `/api/*`, agent spawning, skills, design systems, artifacts, and static serving.
- `apps/desktop` is the Electron shell; it discovers the web URL through sidecar IPC.
- `apps/packaged` is the thin packaged Electron runtime entry; it starts packaged sidecars and owns the `od://` entry glue only.
- `packages/contracts` is the pure TypeScript web/daemon app contract layer.
- `packages/sidecar-proto` owns the Open Design sidecar business protocol; `packages/sidecar` owns the generic sidecar runtime; `packages/platform` owns generic OS process primitives.
- `tools/dev` is the local development lifecycle control plane.
- `tools/pack` is the local packaged build/start/stop/logs control plane, packaged updater harness, installer identity/registry validation surface, and mac beta release artifact preparation surface.
- `tools/pr` is the maintainer PR-duty control plane: a thin `gh` wrapper that encodes this repo's review-lane derivation, forbidden-surface flags, lane checklists, and validation-command suggestions.
- `tools/serve` is the local fixture-service control plane; first service is `tools-serve start updater` for deterministic updater metadata and artifacts.
- `e2e` owns user-level end-to-end smoke tests and Playwright UI automation; read `e2e/AGENTS.md` before editing its tests or commands.

## Inactive or placeholder directories

- `apps/nextjs` and `packages/shared` have been removed; do not recreate or reference them.
- `.od/`, `.tmp/`, Playwright reports, and agent scratch directories are local runtime data and must stay out of git.

# Development workflow

## Environment baseline

- Runtime target is Node `~24` and `pnpm@10.33.2`; use Corepack so the pnpm version pinned in `package.json` is selected.
- New project-owned entrypoints, modules, scripts, tests, reporters, and configs should default to TypeScript.
- Residual JavaScript is limited to generated output, vendored dependencies, explicitly documented compatibility build artifacts, and the allowlist in `scripts/guard.ts`.

## Windows native

- macOS, Linux, and WSL2 are the primary supported paths. Windows native is best-effort — file an issue if it doesn't work.
- Historical Windows-specific friction is documented in closed issues #10, #96, #100, #203, and #315; check the issue tracker for the current state before filing new reports.
- Install Node 24. Either `winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS` (currently Node 24.x) or download from https://nodejs.org. After install, verify with `node --version` — the WinGet LTS pointer rolls to the next major in October 2026, so re-verify if you re-run the install command later. Do not use Node 22 — see FAQ.
- `corepack enable` fails with EPERM on Windows (cannot write shims to `Program Files`). Use `npm install -g pnpm@10.33.2` instead.
- `better-sqlite3` has no prebuilt binary for win32/Node 24; `pnpm install` will compile it from source via node-gyp (~2 min). Requires Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 or newer. This is expected — not a sign of version incompatibility.
- For `tools-dev` start/stop/status usage, see "Local lifecycle" below.

## Local lifecycle

- Use `pnpm tools-dev` as the only local development lifecycle entry point.
- Do not add or restore root lifecycle aliases: `pnpm dev`, `pnpm dev:all`, `pnpm daemon`, `pnpm preview`, or `pnpm start`.
- Ports are governed by `tools-dev` flags: `--daemon-port` and `--web-port`.
- `tools-dev` exports `OD_PORT` for the web proxy target and `OD_WEB_PORT` for the web listener; do not use `NEXT_PORT`.

## Root command boundary

- Keep root scripts reserved for true repo-level checks and tools control-plane entrypoints: `pnpm guard`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm tools-dev`, `pnpm tools-pack`, `pnpm tools-pr`, and `pnpm tools-serve`.
- Do not add root aggregate `pnpm build` or `pnpm test` aliases. Build/test commands must stay package-scoped (`pnpm --filter <package> ...`) or tool-scoped (`pnpm tools-pack ...` / `pnpm tools-pr ...`).
- Do not add root e2e aliases; e2e package commands and ownership rules live in `e2e/AGENTS.md`.

## Release channel model

- `beta` is the daily R&D/development validation channel. It is optimized for fast development feedback and is not part of the stable promotion gate.
- `nightly` is the internal validation channel for stable delivery. Stable releases remain gated by validated nightly artifacts.
- `preview` is an independent early-access channel with stable-like release rigor. It should use preview versions such as `X.Y.Z-preview.N`, publish to the `preview` R2 channel, publish updater feeds under `preview/latest`, and follow stable's platform policy including the existing optional Linux enablement.
- `stable` is the formal delivery channel. Do not make stable promotion depend on preview; stable continues to depend on nightly only.
- Public packaged app identity must stay channel-distinct: stable uses `Open Design`, beta uses `Open Design Beta`, and preview uses `Open Design Preview`. Do not ship beta or preview mac DMGs whose drag-install app bundle is `Open Design.app`.
- Windows beta updater validation must use the real beta namespace `release-beta-win`; otherwise a local beta-like namespace can create a separate uninstall registry key while looking like the same `Open Design Beta` app. See `tools/pack/AGENTS.md` for the architecture map and high-confidence acceptance harness.

## Boundary constraints

- Tests under `apps/`, `packages/`, and `tools/` live in a package/app/tool-level `tests/` directory sibling to `src/`; keep `src/` source-only and do not add new `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx` files under `src/`. Playwright UI automation belongs to `e2e/ui/`, not app packages.
- App packages must not import another app's private `src/` or `tests/` implementation as a shared helper. In particular, `apps/web/**` must not import `apps/daemon/src/**`; web/daemon integration belongs behind HTTP APIs, `packages/contracts`, and app-local provider boundaries.
- Cross-app, cross-runtime, or repository-resource consistency checks belong in `e2e/tests/` when they need to observe more than one app/package boundary; promote reusable logic to a pure package instead of borrowing another app's private source.
- Keep shared API DTOs, SSE event unions, error shapes, task shapes, and example payloads in `packages/contracts`; update contracts before wiring divergent web/daemon request or response shapes.
- Keep `packages/contracts` pure TypeScript and free of Next.js, Express, Node filesystem/process APIs, browser APIs, SQLite, daemon internals, and sidecar control-plane dependencies.
- Keep project-owned entrypoints, modules, scripts, tests, reporters, and configs TypeScript-first; generated `dist/*.js` is runtime output, and source edits belong in `.ts` files.
- New `.js`, `.mjs`, or `.cjs` files need an explicit generated/vendor/compatibility reason and must pass `pnpm guard`.
- App business logic must not know about sidecar/control-plane concepts. Keep sidecar awareness in `apps/<app>/sidecar` or the desktop sidecar entry wrapper.
- Shared web/daemon app contracts belong in `packages/contracts`; that package must not depend on Next.js, Express, Node filesystem/process APIs, browser APIs, SQLite, daemon internals, or the sidecar control-plane protocol.
- Sidecar process stamps must have exactly five fields: `app`, `mode`, `namespace`, `ipc`, and `source`.
- Orchestration layers (`tools-dev`, `tools-pack`, packaged launchers) must call package primitives; do not hand-build `--od-stamp-*` args or process-scan regexes.
- Packaged runtime paths must be namespace-scoped and independent from daemon/web ports; ports are transient transport details only.
- Default runtime files live under `<project-root>/.tmp/<source>/<namespace>/...`; POSIX IPC sockets are fixed at `/tmp/open-design/ipc/<namespace>/<app>.sock`.

## Capability exposure (UI/CLI dual-track)

Every user-facing capability must be reachable through both the web UI **and** the `od` CLI (`apps/daemon/src/cli.ts`). Shipping a feature with only one of the two surfaces is a regression.

- The CLI is the embeddability contract. External agents (hermes-agent, openclaw, custom Slack/Discord bots, packaged runtimes invoked from another shell) drive Open Design through `od` subcommands — they do not render the web UI. If a capability is UI-only, it cannot be composed into those external agents.
- Both surfaces must call the same `/api/*` endpoints; do not let the CLI talk to one shape and the UI to another. The daemon HTTP layer is the single source of truth, with `packages/contracts` carrying the shared DTOs.
- The CLI form must support `--json` for machine-readable output and accept long-form prompts via `--prompt-file <path|->`, so jobs that pipe through `xargs`, `jq`, and `<heredoc` stay clean.
- Adding a new capability is a three-step closure: HTTP endpoint in `apps/daemon/src/*-routes.ts` (with a contract type in `packages/contracts/src/api/`), UI surface in `apps/web/src/`, and `od <capability>` subcommand in `apps/daemon/src/cli.ts` registered through `SUBCOMMAND_MAP`. Land all three in the same PR; do not stage them across PRs.
- The PR template's Surface area checklist must reflect *both* surfaces. If you ticked UI, tick CLI too — and vice-versa — or explain in the PR body why the missing surface is genuinely not applicable (e.g. an internal-only daemon health probe). "I'll do the CLI later" is not a valid reason.
- Existing reference points: `od automation …` mirrors the Automations tab against `/api/routines`; `od plugin …`, `od ui …`, `od project …`, `od media …`, `od mcp …`, `od research …` follow the same shape. Copy that pattern for new capabilities.

## Git commit policy

- Git commits must not include `Co-authored-by` trailers or any other co-author metadata.

## Pull request expectations

- Opening a PR uses `.github/pull_request_template.md`; fill every section, not just the title.
- "Why" must answer both the author's use case (what made you write this PR) and the pain being addressed (user problem, technical debt, prod issue, or unblocker), not just a one-line restatement of the title.
- "What users will see" describes the change from a user's perspective — what they click, what new thing appears, what default behavior changed — not from a code perspective.
- The Surface area checklist must reflect actual surfaces touched; check every box that applies, including extension points (`skills/`, `design-systems/`, `design-templates/`, `craft/`), CLI flags, env vars, i18n keys, and new root `package.json` dependencies.
- If any UI surface is checked, attach screenshots showing the entry point — where users discover the change — not just the feature in isolation; before/after is best for behavior changes.
- For bug-fix PRs, link the red-spec test that reproduces the bug and confirm it went red on `main` and green on the branch, per the `Bug follow-up workflow` section above.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` covers PR scope, title format, dependency policy, and the issue-first rule for non-trivial features; `docs/code-review-guidelines.md` is the reviewer-facing complement.

## Code review guide

- Use `docs/code-review-guidelines.md` as the repository-wide review standard. That document is the operational guide; this `AGENTS.md` is the source of truth when the two disagree.
- Walk reviews top-down through `docs/code-review-guidelines.md`: Product relevance test → forbidden surfaces → ownership/scope → matching lane → checklist → comments → approval bar.
- Pick the matching review lane: default code/tests, contract and protocol changes, design-system additions, skill additions, or craft additions.
- Before reviewing changes under `apps/`, `packages/`, `tools/`, or `e2e/`, read that directory's `AGENTS.md` and apply its local boundaries.
- Blocking review feedback should focus on correctness, security/secrets, data integrity, repository boundary violations, contract/migration breakage, missing required validation, or high-risk maintainability issues.
- Only maintainers may close a PR instead of requesting changes, and only when the change is not salvageable on the existing branch (wrong target product, foreign test harness, DOM/API assumptions absent from this repo, or scripts that conflict with lifecycle rules).

## PR-duty tooling

`pnpm tools-pr` is the maintainer-only control plane for PR-duty work on this repo. It is a thin `gh` wrapper that encodes repo-specific knowledge — review-lane derivation, forbidden-surface flags, per-lane checklists, validation-command suggestions, and a fixed dictionary of factual classify tags (`bot-only-approval`, `needs-rebase`, `stale-approval`, `unresolved-changes-requested`, `awaiting-*` timing, `org-member`, etc.). The tool is read-only on the PR surface: it never approves, merges, comments, or closes; those side effects stay in explicit `gh` invocations the maintainer runs.

Common subcommands:

- `pnpm tools-pr list` — triage the open queue by lane and review-state bucket.
- `pnpm tools-pr view <num>` — factual review brief for a single PR.
- `pnpm tools-pr classify --all` — script-level tag JSON for the whole open queue (entry point for cron / digest consumers); per-PR `classify <num>` for spot checks.
- `pnpm tools-pr assignment` — assigner-perspective ownership + idle-time / blocker view across the queue.

For the full tag dictionary, operational playbook (direct merge / duplicate-title / awaiting-author / org-member / agent-review flows), comment templates, language-detection rules, and tool-design constraints (precision boundaries, factual-output rule, retry + pagination strategy), see [`tools/pr/AGENTS.md`](tools/pr/AGENTS.md).

## Agent runtime conventions

- `RuntimeAgentDef.promptInputFormat` selects how the daemon writes the prompt to a child's stdin. The default `'text'` writes the composed prompt and ends stdin immediately. `'stream-json'` wraps the prompt as one JSONL `user` message and KEEPS stdin open so the daemon can stream further user messages back in mid-turn. Claude (`apps/daemon/src/runtimes/defs/claude.ts`) ships `'stream-json'` together with `--input-format stream-json` so the host can answer interactive tools like `AskUserQuestion` with a real `tool_result` block. Every other agent stays on `'text'`.
- `apps/daemon/src/server.ts` tracks `run.pendingHostAnswers` (a Set of `tool_use_id` strings) and `run.stdinOpen` on the run object. The `claude-stream-json` event handler adds AskUserQuestion ids to the set and closes stdin only when both the set is empty AND a `turn_end` (or `usage`) event arrives with a non `tool_use` `stop_reason`. The `tool_use` stop reason means the model paused mid tool (waiting on claude-code's internal runner or on a host answer); closing stdin there would truncate the follow up response.
- `claude-stream.ts` emits the `turn_end` event AFTER iterating the assistant message's content blocks, not before. When `--include-partial-messages` is unsupported, tool_use events surface only from the assistant wrapper, so emitting `turn_end` first would let the daemon close stdin before the host had registered any pending answers.
- `POST /api/runs/:id/tool-result` is the daemon endpoint for feeding a `tool_result` block back into a still running stream-json child. Body shape: `{ toolUseId: string, content: string, isError?: boolean }`. Web callers use `submitChatRunToolResult` from `apps/web/src/providers/daemon.ts`. The daemon writes a JSONL `user` message containing one `tool_result` content block, removes the id from `pendingHostAnswers`, and lets the next `turn_end` decide when to close stdin.
- AskUserQuestion specifically: Claude's system prompt section in `apps/daemon/src/prompts/system.ts` (Claude only block at the bottom of `composeSystemPrompt`) tells the model to use the tool for 2 to 4 finite choices, and to stop generating tokens after the tool call instead of also writing a markdown duplicate. `AssistantMessage.suppressAskUserQuestionFallbackText` is the belt and suspenders that hides any trailing markdown text in the same turn.

## Chat UI conventions

- `apps/web/src/components/file-viewer-render-mode.ts` decides URL-load vs srcDoc for HTML previews. Bridges (deck, comment/inspect selection, palette, edit, tweaks) can ONLY inject through the srcDoc path. Add a new disqualifier to `UrlLoadDecision` whenever a feature needs a srcDoc-only bridge; pass it from `FileViewer.tsx` based on a source-content heuristic where appropriate (e.g. `hasTweaksTemplate`). The host keeps both iframes mounted simultaneously and swaps CSS visibility so toggling render mode does not cause an iframe reload flash; `iframeRef.current` stays aligned with the active iframe via `useEffect`. Receive filters use `isOurIframe(ev.source)` to accept messages from either iframe but signals that should ONLY come from the active iframe (e.g. `od:tweaks-available`) re-check `ev.source === iframeRef.current?.contentWindow`.
- TodoWrite UI pins one canonical task list above the chat composer via `PinnedTodoSlot` in `ChatPane.tsx`. The slot reads the latest TodoWrite snapshot across the conversation through `latestTodoWriteInputFromMessages` (`apps/web/src/runtime/todos.ts`). `AssistantMessage.stripTodoToolGroups` removes any TodoWrite tool groups from per message rendering so there is exactly one TodoCard on screen. The progress count includes both `completed` and `in_progress` items (1/4 reads "one underway" not "zero finished"). Dismissal via the Done button is keyed on the snapshot's JSON, so a fresh TodoWrite from the agent automatically re shows the card.
- `AskUserQuestionCard` (in `ToolCard.tsx`) prefers the live `onAnswerToolUse(toolUseId, content)` route (POSTs to `/api/runs/:id/tool-result`) and falls back to the legacy `onSubmitForm(text)` path when the run has already terminated. Selected chips persist across reloads by parsing the stored `tool_result.content` back into the selections shape.
- Tool group rendering uses `dedupeSnapshotToolRetries` to collapse identical `AskUserQuestion` retries (one card per unique input, keeping the latest tool_use_id) and `TodoWrite` snapshots (only the most recent call, since each call is a state replace).

## i18n keys

- `apps/web/src/i18n/types.ts` is the typed `Dict`; every key must be defined in all 18 locale files under `apps/web/src/i18n/locales/*.ts` (`ar`, `de`, `en`, `es-ES`, `fa`, `fr`, `hu`, `id`, `ja`, `ko`, `pl`, `pt-BR`, `ru`, `th`, `tr`, `uk`, `zh-CN`, `zh-TW`). Add the key to `types.ts` first; missing translations produce a typecheck error.

## UI animation philosophy

- Default ease-out for UI transitions: `cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1)`. Built-in `ease` is too weak; `ease-in` is forbidden for UI elements because it feels sluggish.
- Asymmetric durations: enter around 200ms, exit around 140ms. Exit reads as decisive because the user has already chosen to dismiss.
- Accordion expand and collapse uses `grid-template-rows: 0fr -> 1fr` (modern auto height pattern). Pair with opacity fade and the easing above. The shared `.accordion-collapsible` + `.accordion-collapsible-inner` class pair (defined in `apps/web/src/index.css`) is the canonical implementation; reuse it for new disclosure UI.
- Never animate from `transform: scale(0)`. Start from `scale(0.9)` or higher with `opacity: 0`.
- For elements that show conditionally, keep them mounted and toggle a CSS class (e.g. `.chat-jump-btn-active`). React unmounts skip the exit transition entirely.

## Validation strategy

- After package, workspace, or command-entry changes, run `pnpm install` so workspace links and generated dist entries stay fresh.
- Before marking regular work ready, run at least `pnpm guard` and `pnpm typecheck`, plus the package-scoped tests/builds that match the files changed. Do not use or add root `pnpm test`/`pnpm build` aliases.
- For local web runtime loops, prefer `pnpm tools-dev run web --daemon-port <port> --web-port <port>`.
- On a GUI-capable machine, validate desktop by running `pnpm tools-dev`, then `pnpm tools-dev inspect desktop status`.
- Stamp/namespace changes must validate two concurrent namespaces and run desktop `inspect eval` plus `inspect screenshot` for each namespace.
- Path/log changes must run `pnpm tools-dev logs --namespace <name> --json` and confirm log paths are under `.tmp/tools-dev/<namespace>/...`.

## Bug follow-up workflow

The following is a working playbook for routine bug follow-ups, distilled from recent practice. Treat it as a default action shape, not a contract — production reality always has edges these bullets can't anticipate, so use judgment when the situation doesn't fit cleanly.

- **Lead with a red spec.** Default to encoding the bug as a falsifiable test that goes red before any source change, so the fix is anchored in observable behavior rather than source-code intuition. If a red spec can't be written cheaply, that's usually a signal to clarify scope rather than push forward on a guess.
- **Try the cheapest layer first.** Reach for the lightest test layer that can still see the symptom (e2e Vitest at the daemon HTTP boundary → app-local Vitest → Playwright UI → platform-native harnesses), and drop down only when the cheaper layer can't.
- **Hold the spec's scope.** Defects discovered outside the bug's described boundary belong in a follow-up — their own red spec, their own PR — not in this fix. List them in the PR body's "Adjacent issues" section with the rationale and move on.
- **Let the fix read as an invariant.** Prefer a named helper whose docblock describes what must hold over a bolt-on `if` guard with apologetic history-comments. The call site should read as intent.
- **Diff against the baseline.** When neighboring suites have pre-existing failures, stash or check out upstream before claiming "no new failures."
- **Link the issue from the PR body.** Use `Fixes #N` / `Closes #N` / `Resolves #N` so the issue auto-closes on merge and the release-time reverse lookup (`gh issue view N --json closedByPullRequestsReferences` → `git tag --contains <merge sha>`) actually has a chain to follow. The repo's PR template prompts for this; deleting the prompt is fine when the PR genuinely closes nothing.
- **Stage human verification for visible bugs.** When the symptom needs an eye to confirm — UI, platform-native behavior, animations, race conditions a unit test can't see — green specs alone aren't acceptance. Stand up a buggy-vs-fix comparison the reviewer can drive themselves (typical shape: two namespaced runtimes, one on `main`, one on the fix branch), and seed any required data only through production HTTP APIs; source-level test backdoors invalidate the verification because they prove a fake flow rather than the real one.

For a worked example of one full loop (red e2e spec → fix → green), see `e2e/tests/dialog/stop-reconciles-message.test.ts` (issue #135).

# FAQ

## Why is there no root `pnpm dev` / `pnpm start`?

To avoid starting daemon, web, and desktop through inconsistent env, port, namespace, or log paths. All local lifecycle flows must go through `pnpm tools-dev`.

## Why should `apps/nextjs` not be restored?

The current web runtime is `apps/web`. The historical `apps/nextjs` layout has been removed from the active repo shape; restoring it would reintroduce duplicate app boundaries and stale scripts.

## How does desktop discover the web URL?

Desktop queries runtime status through sidecar IPC. The web URL comes from `tools-dev` launch status, not from desktop guessing ports or reading web internals.

## How are sidecar-proto, sidecar, and platform split?

`@open-design/sidecar-proto` owns Open Design app/mode/source constants, namespace validation, stamp fields/flags, IPC message schema, status shapes, and error semantics. `@open-design/sidecar` provides only generic bootstrap, IPC transport, path/runtime resolution, launch env, and JSON runtime files. `@open-design/platform` provides only generic OS process stamp serialization, command parsing, and process matching/search primitives, consuming the proto descriptor.

## Where is data written?

The daemon writes `.od/` by default: SQLite at `.od/app.sqlite`, agent CWDs under `.od/projects/<id>/`, saved renders under `.od/artifacts/`, and credentials at `.od/media-config.json`. Two env vars override the storage root, in order:

1. `OD_DATA_DIR=<dir>` — relocates *all* daemon runtime data to `<dir>` (used by Playwright for test isolation, and by the packaged daemon and the Home Manager / NixOS modules to point the daemon at a writable directory when the install root is read-only). The path is resolved with `~/` expansion and relative paths anchored to `<projectRoot>`.
2. `OD_MEDIA_CONFIG_DIR=<dir>` — narrower override that relocates *only* `media-config.json`. Same resolution semantics. Most installs do not need this; it exists for setups that want to keep API credentials in a different location from the rest of the runtime data.

Default precedence is OD_MEDIA_CONFIG_DIR > OD_DATA_DIR > `<projectRoot>/.od`.

## When is `pnpm install` required?

Run `pnpm install` after changing package manifests, workspace layout, command entrypoints, bin/link-related content, or after adding/removing workspace packages.

## Can I use Node 22 instead of Node 24?

No. `package.json#engines` specifies `node: "~24"`, which is the only supported runtime. The current lockfile pins `better-sqlite3@11.10.0`; on Windows it has no prebuilt binary for Node 24 and is built from source via node-gyp (see the Windows native section). Older Node versions are not tested and may hit lockfile or dependency incompatibilities.
