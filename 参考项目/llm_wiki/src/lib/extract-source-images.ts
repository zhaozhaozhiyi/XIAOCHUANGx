/**
 * Image extraction orchestration for the ingest pipeline.
 *
 * Pure dispatch + path-shaping layer over the Rust commands
 * `extract_and_save_pdf_images_cmd` / `extract_and_save_office_images_cmd`.
 * Decides which command to call based on file extension, computes the
 * destination directory (`wiki/media/<source-slug>/`), and gives back
 * a small markdown snippet ready to paste into the LLM's source
 * context.
 *
 * NOTE: this layer does NOT call any LLM (no captions yet — that's
 * Phase 3a). The alt text on each image is a placeholder; once
 * captioning lands, the same helper grows a `caption` field per
 * image and the markdown line uses that instead.
