/**
 * Caption-the-images pipeline + persistent cache.
 *
 * Sits between the Rust extractor (which lands images on disk under
 * `wiki/media/<slug>/`) and the ingest LLM (which sees source
 * markdown with `![](abs_path)` references). The job is twofold:
 *
 *   1. For each image referenced in the source markdown, get a
 *      factual caption from the vision model — using the cache if
 *      we've described those exact bytes before.
 *
 *   2. Rewrite the markdown so each `![](path)` becomes
 *      `![<caption>](path)`. The summarizer LLM stripping empty-alt
 *      images is the failure mode this exists to prevent: an alt-
 *      texted image carries enough semantic load that the model
 *      preserves it through paraphrasing.
 *
 * Cache key = SHA-256 of image bytes. This makes duplicate images
 * across PDFs (logos, page headers, recurring chart templates) a
 * single LLM call across the whole project — without it, a corpus
 * of slide decks with shared brand assets would caption the same
 * logo hundreds of times.
 *
 * Cache file lives at
 *   `<project>/.llm-wiki/image-caption-cache.json`
 * keyed `{ "<sha256>": { caption, mimeType, model, capturedAt } }`.
 * The model + capturedAt fields aren't read by anything yet but
 * shipping the metadata now means we can implement Phase 4's
 * "re-caption with new model" without a second cache version.
 *
 * Why JSON-on-disk and not LanceDB / sqlite: the cache is small
 * (10s of KB on real corpora), human-readable for debugging
 * ("why is this caption wrong?"), and survives `npm run dev`
 * restarts — no migration story needed when the embedding-side
 * schema changes. If we ever cache 100k+ images we'll revisit.
