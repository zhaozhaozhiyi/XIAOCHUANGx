/**
 * Vision-caption helper. Sends one image + a fixed factual prompt to a
 * vision-capable LLM and returns the model's plain-text description.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 *
 *   The image-extraction step (Phase 1) lands raster images on disk
 *   under `wiki/media/<source-slug>/`, but the text we hand to the
 *   ingest LLM contains those images as `![](...)` references with
 *   EMPTY alt text — meaningless to a text-only summarizer. Generation
 *   models silently strip empty-alt images when paraphrasing the
 *   source, so wiki pages that should reference figures end up with
 *   no figure at all. Worse: the embedding side has no semantic
 *   signal for those images, so chart-only PDF pages embed as their
 *   surrounding text only and rank far below where they should.
 *
 *   captionImage solves both: a 2-4 sentence factual description per
 *   image gives the summarizer something to preserve, and (post-
 *   Phase 5) gives the embedding step token-bearing content to
 *   index alongside the image bytes.
 *
 * What this is NOT:
 *
 *   This module knows nothing about ingest, caching, or where the
 *   image lives on disk. The caller passes raw base64 + mediaType,
 *   handles persistence (Phase 3b layers caching + ingest wiring on
 *   top), and decides whether to run captioning at all (Phase 4
 *   adds a settings toggle).
 *
 * Cost model (read this before you call this in a loop):
 *
 *   Each call is one round-trip to the vision endpoint with the full
 *   image bytes inline. A 100-page paper with 30 figures = 30 vision
 *   calls. Caching by image SHA-256 (Phase 3b) lets duplicate logos
 *   / chart templates / academic-figure boilerplate dedupe to one
 *   call across an entire corpus — without it the cost scales
 *   linearly with figure count and we'll routinely 10x the budget
 *   on chart-heavy decks.

/**
 * The "no surrounding text" prompt — same factual / verbatim /
 * no-speculation framing we've used since Phase 3a. Used when the
 * caller has no context to supply (e.g. a captioning helper called
 * directly without a document, or when context is intentionally
 * disabled). Pinned, not parameterized.
 *
 * Reasons:
 *   - Factual / no-speculation framing reduces hallucination
 *     ("Describe ... factually" vs. "What is this?"). Ablation
 *     against an early "describe this image" prompt produced
 *     captions like "this appears to be a successful business
 *     metric" for a literal screenshot of a SQL query.
 *
 *   - Verbatim text capture matters for diagrams, slide bullets,
 *     and figure callouts — a vision model will paraphrase OCR
 *     unless told not to.
 *
 *   - 2-4 sentences is the sweet spot empirically: 1 sentence
 *     loses chart-axis detail; 6+ sentences burns tokens AND
 *     produces editorial filler that hurts retrieval relevance.
 *
 *   - "no markdown, no preamble" prevents the caption from breaking
 *     when we splice it as alt text (`![CAPTION](path)` — newlines
 *     or markdown inside CAPTION corrupt the surrounding doc).
